# Learning JavaScript, 3rd Edition
Most of this is a way to learn git.  I downloaded a file I developed on
Plunker to show the differences between using Math.round() and
Math.floor() to choose a random number.  This script prints out the
number of times each random number was chosen.  I want to add css
so that a nice graph is made, too.
